## Steps in short
`sudo apt update && sudo apt install silversearcher-ag`  

## Story behind
Yes, I'm still on debian.  
So I was looking through `helm-projectile` [bugs](https://github.com/bbatsov/helm-projectile/issues) to find anything I could do and I found this bug about ag. Turned out it was a so-much-faster-then-grep `grep`. I love it.

In [spac]emacs invoke it with `helm-projectile-ag`.
