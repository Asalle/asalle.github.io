It indeed is. How many times we did not yet have CI checks for line endings, trailing whitespaces and other small but incredibly annoying stuff and it got into our git history? Now you can just add a .editorconfig and the war of tabs vs spaces will be won!

Most IDEs have native support of editorconfig, the rest have a plugin to install.
