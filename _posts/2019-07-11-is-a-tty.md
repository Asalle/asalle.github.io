We use `op/logging` [[link](https://github.com/op/go-logging)] for logs now. One of its many features is printing out the time the message was logged:

The only thing is, when starting our binary as a `systemd` service we see logs with `journalct` who already adds the timestamp on its own, we get a double timestamp.
Fortunately, we can avoid it by checking if `stdout` file descriptor is a tty or not.

Like so (_credit: github.com/mattn/go-isatty_):
```
package main

import (
	"fmt"
	"github.com/mattn/go-isatty"
	"os"
)

func main() {
	if isatty.IsTerminal(os.Stdout.Fd()) {
		fmt.Println("Is Terminal")
	} else {
		fmt.Println("Is Not Terminal")
	}
}
```

Happy logging!
