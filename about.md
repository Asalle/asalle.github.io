Hello, my name is Asalle, or Asa for short!   
I like programming, experimenting with hardware and software and learning radically new things. My other interests include time-, attention- and energy management, self-tracking, goal-setting and project management.  

P. S. When it comes to collecting your data - I'm a total [Ants-in-my-eyes Jonson](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G4BkGJj5BXg). I do not track anything, I don't even know you're here. Everything is black, I can't see a thing. And also I can't feel a anything, did I mention that? Am I standing? Sitting? I don't know.  

Other than that, I'm completely fine.  
  
I love feedback - drop me a line anytime!  
Asalle
